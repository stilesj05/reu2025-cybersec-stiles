# Quantum-Enhanced Graph Optimization for Trustworthy Multi-Agent Coordination in Digital Twin Robots

## üìö Student & Mentor Information
- **Student**: [Jaydine Stiles, Joseph Ko]  
- **Mentor**: [Dr. Yugyung Lee]

## üîç Project Summary
As robotic systems become increasingly central to critical applications such as autonomous delivery, search and rescue, healthcare, and manufacturing, ensuring secure and trustworthy coordination between agents is essential. These systems often use **Digital Twins (DTs)**‚Äîvirtual replicas that enable real-time simulation, planning, and monitoring.

This research explores how **Quantum AI**, particularly **quantum-enhanced graph optimization**, can improve multi-agent coordination by enabling:
- Real-time **task allocation**, **path planning**, and **load balancing**.
- **Trust-aware coordination**, anomaly detection, and secure decision-making.
- The construction of **dynamic multi-layered knowledge graphs** to represent physical robots, DTs, environments, and human operators.

Our goal is to increase both **operational efficiency** and **security assurance** in collaborative robotic environments.
